i updated this to work with fabric 0.16.9 in probly a really janky way that chatgpt told me how to do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
A simple Fabric mod to help secure your Minecraft server by blocking incoming connections unless they come from TCPShield proxies.

### Features
- **No Config Needed**: The mod automatically fetches TCPShield proxy ranges.
- **Blocks Early**: Unauthorized connections are blocked at the handshake packet.
- **Just works**: Just drop it in and it's good to go.

### How It Works
The mod pulls TCPShield proxy ranges when your server starts and blocks any incoming traffic that doesn't come from these proxies at the handshake packet.

### Important Note
I'm not affiliated with TCPShield; this is just a passion project to help keep servers secure. I made it because I needed something like it and couldn't find a good option.

### Support
For any issues or questions, please open a GitHub issue on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/nullsoepic/tcpshield/issues/new).
